Guidelines to BTP/MTP/DDP Project reports.
Prof. Krishna Sivalingam
March 2012
=================================================

RULE 1: No CUT-AND-PASTE figures or text from anywhere. We will use
plagiarism detection software to help you avoid such mistakes.

What if a definition has to be cited from a book or other paper?

You can write it as, 
"Integration is described as blah blah blah", as defined in [2].

What if there is a good diagram from some other source? Redraw it
yourself and give credit to the source by stating, "Adapted from
[3].". 

=================================================

RULE 2: Learn some important Software, in the first semester of your
project. 

* Latex, Bibtex, tikz/pgf
* dia/xfig  or similar drawing tools
* gnuplot  or similar drawing tools (but no charts using excel)

You should prepare a 10-page latex-based report that includes conceptual
diagrams/picture (eps files from dia/xfig) and sample graphs (eps
files from gnuplot) at the end of your first semester.

=================================================

Important Note: bibtex entries downloaded from the web will need to be
cleaned up, especially the ones from IEEE Xplore, etc.

Note the extra '{}' needed to preserve uppercase; bibtex converts
EVERYTHING (upper case) to everything (lower case).

ABSTRACT:

1 page: 2 paras. 

First para: Brief description of problem, with necessary background
about problem and its motivation.

Second para: Brief description about proposed approach/technique to
solve the problem; how the approach was studied/analyzed and important
results of analysis.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Ch 1: Introduction

Introduction chapter is like an extended abstract. It has to tell the
story of your work, such that the reader can stop reading with the
Intro. and still know approx. what your work was about.

Note: Every chapter will begin with a brief introduction to the
chapter contents. DO NOT have sections within a chapter OR subsections
with a section, etc. WITHOUT a brief. sentence or para about that
chapter/section.

1.1 Overview and Problem Statement (2-3 pages) with 2-3 subsections

A one-to-two page overview for the topic/system/problem, ending with a
specific Problem Statement. What is the complexity of the problem? How
is it placed with respect to the state-of-the-art?

INCLUDE at least ONE diagram to give perspective to the
system/problem. NOTE: All graphs and figures must be referenced in the
text.

1.2 Motivation (0.5 to 1 page)

Why is the system and problem so important? Who would/should care
about your work?

1.3 Contributions of this work ( 1 to 2 page)

Briefly describe your approach (and hypothesis as to why you think
this will work better), comparison to existing work (i.e. why is other
existing work not adequate), what is novel about your
problem/approach?

Discuss perf. analysis scenarios, parameters varied and metrics
measured. Summarize the important results in a PARAGRAPH.

1.4 Orgn. of the thesis.

Total: Around 6 - 10 pages.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Ch 2. Background and Related Work.

There are two main parts: background material needed to understand.

For eg, in a sensor network project, you will describe the basic
concepts of sensors, sensor networks, overall design challenges, etc.

Use figures liberally and as needed. All graphs and figures must be
referenced in the text.

Related Work: If you are working in Target tracking, then describe all
work RELATED to your specific problem/approach. Highlight the
strengths and weaknesses and key results of each approach. 

This should not be a monotonous summary of each work - one para. per
paper read. Provide some personal insights.

Conclude this section by stating HOW your work is better than existing
related work.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Ch 3. Proposed Mechanism/Algorithm (If you have a name for the alg,
even better)

3.1 Necessary Network/System Architecture

3.2 RESTATE the Problem Definition. Highlight the challenges involved
in designing a good/optimal solution. What is the complexity of the
problem? Elaborate - is it NP-hard, NP-complete etc.

3.3 Proposed Idea

Figures, Examples to illustrate the concepts/ideas/algorithm are VERY
important.

Again, make sure that you highlight the novelty of your work/approach.

3.4 Implementation Details (either here or in Chapter 4, as
appropriate). For example, were specialized data structures needed?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Ch 4. Performance Study

4.1 Simulation Environment
    
    Describe the Software package used, if any. Why was it selected
    over others? 
    Describe System Parameters Varied
    Metrics Measured - define each metric precisely.

4.2 Scenario 1: Results and Analysis

Subsections as needed. Analysis is very important - do not state "The
results are in Fig. 3; as you can obviously see, my algorithm is
cool". Report the trends seen - one is better than the other; the
improvement perc. ranges from 5 to 15%. Also, why do you think Alg A's
perf. is not as good as Alg B. 

All graphs and figures must be referenced in the text.

4.3 Scenario 2: Results and Analysis

Subsections as needed.

4.4: Summary of perf. study

What did you learn after all these experiments/analysis? Is your
alg. always better or only better in some cases; is the time
complexity suitable.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Ch 5. Conclusions and Future Work.

Conclusions - should be a paragraph. What did you start out to study?
Did you accomplish that goal? What are the main findings? are they
along expected lines? are they satisfactory or is this a startling
revelation (e.g. Bubble sort is not as bad as one thinks it to be)?

In future work, think of students who might want to follow upon this
work. Think of additions to the work, potential improvements to the
existing technique. Whatever you wanted to do with respect to the
project (usually, this gyan comes during report writing phase) but
could not do, may be written here.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ch 6. References.

-- These should be properly formatted, complete and with no mistakes.

All journal citations should have month, year, volume, issue number
and pages.

All conference citations should have month, year, location of
conference (Explore might simply state New York for all ACM papers -
but that is ACM's address, not the conference location) and page
numbers, if available.

All URL citations must include Date last accessed. Remember that URLs
are not archival and may be gone by the time someone reads it.

-- See note about bibtex earlier.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Appendix. 

If necessary, for routine or even complex math. derivations
that might distract the reader if placed in the chapter itself.

For software/simulation systems, describe ALL the implementation
details here. For example, what were the modules modified in OMNET++,
what kind of changes were implemented. If someone wants to use your
code, how should they go about modifying etc.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

After submitting the report, please a 6-8 paper conference paper in
IEEE 2-column format. Look at other papers from our graph or elsewhere
to see what should be in a conference paper. If this is completed
within 2 days after the viva, then an 'S' grade can be recommended;
otherwise, ... 8-)
