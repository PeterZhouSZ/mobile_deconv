Mobile Platform and image processing
-------------------------------------

The project aims at using a mobile platform for testing various image processing algorithms like image registration, depth estimation and image deconvolution. The repository is laid out as follows:

- host: Contains the python scripts for the host side image processing.
- papers: Contains all the reference papers used during the project
- thesis: Contains the latex file for the final thesis
- wp8_app: Contains the Windows Phone 8 application files.
- README.md: This file.
- LICENSE: License file

The Windows Phone 8 app was written for Nokia Lumia 520. Hence, the app should work on any Windows Phone 8 platform. To get a good overview of the project, the report in the thesis folder can be used. To get in-depth details about code, the comments in the file should suffice.
