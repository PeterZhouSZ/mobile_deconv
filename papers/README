This folder contains all the reference papers for the project. Broadly, there are three projects, hence three folders.
1. Detecting motion blur using inertial sensors
2. Extracting motion blur information from motion blur itself. (Clarity necessary)
3. Working on coded aperture.

Along with each paper, there should be a text/docx file containing the gist and the necessary comprehensible information extracted from the corresponding paper.
